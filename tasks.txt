Create pipeline (decode, Detect and classify) on Intel HW (CPU and GPU) run pipeline on CPU,
GPU. Figure out how many cameras streams are supported, what is optimum FPS which model best
on Intel HW.
Outcomes
• Maximum number of streams, FPS and Model on CPU
• Maximum number of streams, FPS and Model on GPU
• Bottleneck CPU, GPU, or IO
• Create a 3-page report on the chosen problem, Pipeline, and results of each model
